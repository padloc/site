As a user of Padloc, you entrust us with some of your most sensitive and
private data and we recognise the immense responsibility that comes with this.
Padloc is built from the ground up with a focus on security, privacy and
transparency and we employ these principles every step along the way when
handling your data. As a security-sensitive service, cryptography and
information security is at the very heart of our product. Unfortunately, these
principles can be very hard to grasp for non-technical users and even though
our source code is open and [available publicly]({{< param "github_url" >}}),
we understand that few people actually have the technical knowledge and
expertise to assess the security of an application like Padloc, which is why
independent security audits and penetration test by reputable third parties are
an essential part of our security practices.

**In Spring 2019, the security experts at [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.trust)
performed a cryptographic review of the Padloc 3 application.** The
goal of the audit was to identify any potential design flaws and implementation
problems within the core components used throughout the application.

We're happy to announce that no critical issues were discovered and all relevant
problems were addressed immediately and have since been fixed. All findings, as
well as the mitigations and fixes performed by our team, can be found in the report
prepared by NCC Group, which is available publicly on their
website:

We'd like to thank the [Open Tech Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/) for
generously funding this audit as well as NCC Group for their thorough and
professional work!

As the custodians of some of your most sensitive and private data, we are committed to
the highest security standards and will continue to work with independent
security experts to make sure Padloc lives up the high expectations and trust
our users place in us. If you'd like to know more about Padlocs security design
and the underlying cryptographic principles, you can find detailed explanations
and specifications in our [security whitepaper]({{< param "security_whitepaper_url" >}}).
And of course, if you'd like to dig even deeper, the entire source code is
publicly available on [Github]({{< param "github_url" >}}).
