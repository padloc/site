After months of hard work, we're thrilled to announce another major update:
**Padloc 3.0**! This is the most significant update in quite some time and
we can't wait to tell you about all the improvements and exciting new
features we have in store for you!

{{< note >}}
**Are you an existing Padloc user?** Padloc 3 accounts are handled separately
from the old "Padlock Cloud" accounts, so you'll have to create a new account
for Padloc 3. Don't worry though, your billing info and any active subscriptions
will be transferred automatically and migrating your data is super easy. For
detailed instructions on how to migrate to Padloc 3, check out
[this article]({{< relref "help/migration/migrate-v3.md" >}}). Or if you'd rather keep
using version 2 for a while, you can still find the legacy apps in the [downloads section](/downloads/#legacy)!

## Padlock Becomes Padloc

First off, if you've been following the projects development, you probably noticed
something weird about the title. No, it's not a typo! Along with the release
of version 3.0 we decided to also introduce a minor rebranding. We've dropped the
"k" from the name making it a little less generic, more memorable and frankly easier
to recognize by search engines. Also, we love how it looks in our new logo! 😌

## Introducing Organizations And Shared Vaults

Let's start with the most significant new feature introduced in Padloc 3:
**Organizations and Shared Vaults**. While previous versions of Padloc only
supported storing data in your own, private store, Padloc 3 now allows you to
create "shared vaults" that can be used to securely share passwords, documents
and other items among multiple users! These shared vaults are managed as part
of "organizations", which can represent anything from small teams and
families to large companies and institutions. While under the hood this
signifies a considerable increase in complexity, we've worked hard to retain
the same simple and intuitive user experience that our users have come to love
in Padloc!

## Store And Share Files With Attachments

Storing passwords, credit card numbers and notes is not enough for you? We get
it! After all, a lot of sensitive information is stored within pdf documents,
Excel tables, photos and all kinds of other files. Well, fret not, we've
got you covered! Padloc 3 introduces **Attachments**, a simple and intuitive
way to store sensitive documents along with your other data. Just like
everything else stored in Padloc, attachments are encrypted and protected by
your master password. And best of all, they can be shared with other Padloc users
via the new [shared vaults feature](#introducing-organizations-and-shared-vaults)!
Perfect for storing digital copies of important documents, managing RSA keys
for your team, or sharing juicy photos with your loved ones (we won't judge
😉).

## New Web Interface

Having an app remember your passwords is useless if you don't have access to
them when you most need them, which is why portability is key in any good
password manager. Our cross-platform app has always made it easy to access your
data from all your favorite devices, but what about those times when you're on
somebody else's computer and want to check your email? Or if you're phone's
battery dies and you desperately need your credit card details? Well, we've got
good news! With our new web interface, you can now access your data directly
from the browser! Simply go to [https://web.padloc.app](https://web.padloc.app) and log
in using your email and master password! Our web interface uses the latest
browser technology to protect you when browsing your data and as always,
everything is protected by strong end-to-end encryption so nobody (not even us)
has a chance to steal your data.

include an improved user interface, a new "favorites" feature, biometric unlock
via fingerprint or FaceID and lots of other cool things! What are you waiting for?
