Creating a Padloc account is simple and takes only a few moments. To get
started, you can either open the Padloc web app by going to
https://web.padloc.app or by downloading and installing the app. The first
thing you'll see is a login screen. Since you don't have an account yet, you
can't login at this point. Instead, click on **Sign Up Now**.

## Step 1: Enter your name and email address

First, you'll be asked for an **email address** and your **name**.

{{< /figure >}}

Your **email address** is used as a username for logging into your account, as well
as as the standard delivery method for 2-factor authentication. We'll also use
this address to send you important updates about your account, organizations
you are a member of and various other things. For more information about how we
handle your email and other personal information, please refer to our [privacy
policy](/privacy).

You may also enter a **display name** that will tell us how you'd like to be
referred to. This is especially useful in case you join any organizations (like
your shared Family account or Company) as it will make it easier for others to
identify you. This doesn't have to be your full or even your real name and can
be changed at any time later on. It is also completely optional so you can just
leave this empty for now if you want.

## Step 2: Confirm your email address

As mentioned before, your email address will be used for things like two-factor
authentication and will generally identify your account within Padloc, so we
first need to make sure you actually own it. To do this, we will send you an
email with 6-digit confirmation code. To proceed, simply enter this code in
the provided field and click **Continue**.

## Step 3: Choose your master password

This is the most important step of the signup process (don't worry, it is also
the last) so you should pay close attention to what is happening here. Your
**master password** is used to protect your account and all the information
stored within it and although we use always use strong encryption to protect
your data **this protection is only as strong as the master password you
choose**. At the same time, **we will never store a copy of your password
anywhere and will not be able to help you recover it** in case you forget it, so
you want to make sure to use something that is both hard to guess and easy to
remember. We know this is not an easy task, so the app will assist you by
suggesting a strong password for you to use. This is a secure passphrase that
is randomly generated from a list of the most common words in the English
language (or whichever language you have set in your system preferences, as
long as it is supported) using a variation of the [diceware
method](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice).
This passphrase may not look particularly secure, but we assure you it is
likely much better than anything you would come up by yourself (no offence) and
it certainly is a lot easier to remember than a string of random characters!

Don't like your suggested password? No problem! You can shuffle through more
random phrases by clicking **Try Another One** until you find one you like
(the generator has been known to spit out some hilarious combinations from time
to time 😋). If this still doesn't yield the desired result, you can choose
a more hands-on approach by selecting clicking **Choose My Own**. This will present
you with the option to pick a password entirely by yourself or you can bring up
a password generator that will give you much more control over how the password
is generated. You can even choose a different language or increase the number
of words used (4 words should be good enough for most personal uses but if you
want to be safe, choosing 5, 6 or 7 words will make your password even more secure).

Once you've chosen your master password, all that is left to do is to confirm it
by repeating it in the field below (peeking is allowed). Aaand that's it! You're
now all set to start using Padloc!

**Important**: As mentioned above, we don't keep a copy of your master password
anywhere and we won't be able to recover it if you forget it! To be safe, we
recommend writing it down on a piece of paper and storing it somewhere save, at
least until you've safely memorized it. **Don't store your master password
digitally in any form and don't tell it to anybody else!**
