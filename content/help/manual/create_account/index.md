## Step 4: Create Your Master Password

This is the last password you **HAVE TO REMEMBER** and will be the most important password that you **NEED TO
REMEMBER**. *(See READ ME, below).*

{{< figure caption="Coming up with a good password is hard, but Padloc's got you covered." >}}

You can use a generated Master Password as your key to your new second brain or you can create one for yourself.  If
utilizing the Master Password generator and you do not like what is generated keep clicking **Try Another One** until
you find one you like and can remember.  If you want additional
options to set/change the parameters of a generated password or create one yourself, click **Choose Your Own**.

{{< /figure >}}

If you still want to use a generator, click **Generate Another**.  Choose then between a **random string** or **passphrase**.

In random string you have all the options for lower and/or upper case and/or numbers and/or symbols and from 5 up to 50 generated characters.

{{< /figure >}}

In passphrase you can change the word separator (dash, underscore, slash, or space) and choose three to six random words in a language of your choice (English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and French).

{{< /figure >}}

You can keep clicking “**Regenerate**” if you don’t like the first option(s) outputted.  

To create your own password, click **Discard**.  You will return to the main password generator.  Click **Choose Your
Own** then **Choose My Own**.  Input whatever password you would like.  Click **Ok**.

**TIPS:**

* Use a combo of upper and lower case, symbols, and numbers
* Create a passphrase that’s easy to remember for you but hard enough for everyone else.
* Checkout the [Dice method](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice).

Click **Continue**.  Welcome to Padloc and your encrypted portal!

{{< note >}}
**READ ME:**

**Padloc does not save or store Master Passwords.  Should you forget your Master Password you will need to recreate the account which will reset your portal and you will
lose all previously stored information, so choose a password that is easy to remember, but hard enough for someone to
guess.**

* Until you have memorized your Master Password, Padloc recommends writing it down.  

* Do not share it with anyone (Padloc offers a solution to share passwords safely) and don’t store the password, in a random digital file or folder.  

Padloc uses a strong encryption to protect your data, but this **protection is only as strong as the Master Password** you
choose.
