## **Step 4: Create Your Master Password**

This is the last password you **HAVE TO REMEMBER** and will be the most important password that you **NEED TO REMEMBER**.

You can use a generated Master Password as your key to your new second brain or you can create one for yourself.

**READ ME:**

**Should you forget your Master Password you will need to recreate the account which will reset your portal and you will lose all previously stored information, so choose a password that is easy to remember, but hard enough for someone to guess.**

* Until you have memorized your Master Password, we recommend writing it down.  

* Do not share it with anyone (we have a solution to share Passwords safely).  And don’t store the password, in a random digital file or folder.  

We always use a strong encryption to protect data, but **this protection is only as strong as the Master Password** you choose.

A few tips on creating your own password:

* Use a combo of upper and lower case, symbols, and numbers
* Create a passphrase that’s easy to remember for you but hard enough for everyone else.
* Checkout the [Dice method](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-how-make-super-secure-password-using-dice).
