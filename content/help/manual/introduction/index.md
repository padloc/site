We've all been there. There is just so many accounts, passwords and other information to keep track of
it seems impossible not get confused and overwhelmed. And to make things worse, every website and app has
their own arbitrary rules for passwords and usernames that not only make each signup an annoying chore but
end up making each password even harder to remember. This problem has existed for ages, but the situation
seems to get worse by the minute, as every day countless new apps and websites emerge that all want not only
part of your attention, but some of your personal data as well. **Properly protecting your digital presence
has become more important than ever** and we've long since gotten to the point where trying to keep
all your passwords and other sensitive information in your head seems not only impractical but downright
irresponsible.

## There's an app for that.

Of course, there is an app for that. Quite few in fact. Password managers exist
in all shapes and colors, and have become an important part of many peoples
digital lives. You've never heard of password managers, or are you not quite
clear on how they work? The amazing people at the [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/animated-overview-using-password-managers-stay-safe-online)
explain it much better than we ever could:

## Enter Padloc

As we've mentioned before, there are quite a few password managers out there
and many of them are quite good! So why should you choose Padloc over other
password managers? Well, there are lots of reasons, but instead of listing a bunch
of dry arguments we'd rather just show you! So why don't you go ahead and just
[give it a try]({{< relref "../create_account" >}})?
