title: Announcing Padlock for Mac (Beta)
---

Today we're happy to announce the first beta release of **Padlock for Mac**! The
new, native desktop app can be downloaded and installed directly from our site
without the need of any additional software (previously the app could only be
installed through the Chrome Web Store). Of course, Padlock for Mac can be
paired with Padlock Cloud so you can easily synchronize your data with your iOS
or Android device! Head over to the <a href="/downloads/">downloads page</a> to
get the app now!

Note that Padlock for Mac is still in beta, so some instability is to be
expected. Releases for Windows and Linux are coming soon, so stay tuned!
