**We're very excited to announce the release of Padlock 2.0!** This new version
comes with many major enhancements, like improved overall stability and
performance, increased security and, most importantly, a completely overhauled
user experience.

## A Fresh New Look

Padlock is now prettier and more functional than ever! For Padlock 2.0 we came
up with a completely new design that combines the minimalist playfulness of the
old look with a stronger focus on efficiency and usablity. The new user
interface gives you faster and easier access to your data while making slighly
more complex tasks like editing records or generating passwords much more
efficient and intuitive. [Let us know](mailto:support@padlock.io) what you
think of the new design!

**Note:** Since Padlock 2.0 uses a slightly different encryption scheme than
older versions, you might experience problems when trying to synchronize a
device running 2.0 with devices running 1.x. Don't worry though,
you can fix the problem by simply updating all your devices to the latest
version!

## More Security, Better Performance

Apart from the visual overhaul, this release also features a lot of improvements
under the hood. Padlock 2.0 was built from the ground up with stability, security
and performance in mind and you'll notice these changes in the form of faster
loading times, more responsiveness and an overall smoother user experience.

## Internationalization

Padlock wants to speak your language! So far Padlock has only been available in
English but this is going to change! Starting with this release we will be gradually
adding translations for other languages to make the app more accessible to our
users around the world. Padlock 2.0 features German as the first supported language
besides English. Do you want to help translate Padlock into your language?

## Padlock for Desktop

Padlock for Desktop has been available as a beta version for a while now. With
the release of Padlock 2.0, we are happy to announce that **both the MacOS and
Windows clients are now officially out of beta!** We've also added lots of
optimizations to make full use of the larger form factor like keyboard
shortcuts and a new layout for bigger screens. If you have the app installed
already, you should receive the update automatically. If not, go ahead and
grab it from the [downloads page](/downloads/)!

**Note:** With the first stable release of our native desktop apps, we strongly
encourage users who have been using [Padlock for
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/padlock/npkoefjfcjbknoeadfkbcdpbapaamcif)
to switch to the new, native client. Read [this announcement]({{< relref

## Stay Tuned For More

With this big chunk of a release out of the way, we can once more focus on
smaller, incremental improvements so get ready for a steady stream of updates
in the near future! If you find any problems with the app or have any suggestions
for improvements, let us know [here](https://github.com/MaKleSoft/padlock/issues)
