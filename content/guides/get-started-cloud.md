**Padlock Cloud** is an online storage service for Padlock that allows you to
securely store your data in the cloud where you can access it conveniently from
all your different devices. Getting started with Padlock Cloud is simple! This
article will show you, how.

## 1. Setup Padlock

First, you'll want to have the Padlock app installed on all your devices you
want to access your data with. You can find versions for all major platforms
on our [downloads page](/downloads/).

When you launch Padlock for the first time, it'll guide through a simple setup
process. In the first step, it'll ask you to provide the email address for your
Padlock Cloud account, then you'll continue by selecting and confirming your
master password.

**Hint:** If you skipped providing a Padlock Cloud email during the setup
process you can always do this later in the Padlock Cloud settings screen (the
little cloud icon in the header bar).

## 2. Check Your Email

When you finish the setup process, Padlock will send an email to the address
you provided. Check your inbox and open the link enclosed in the
email. It'll take you to the **Padlock Cloud Dashboard** where you'll be shown
a success message.

The [Padlock Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard/) is where you
can manage your Padlock Cloud account, see all you paired devices and more.
You can return here any time by visiting
[https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard/](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard/) in
your browser. For now, return to the app where you should be shown another
success message. If no success message is shown, go to the Padlock Cloud
settings screen (the little cloud icon in the header bar) and click **Refresh**.

## 3. Enter Your Data

Once you've setup Padlock on your fist device and paired it with your Padlock
Cloud account, you can start entering your data. Padlock will automatically
synchronize all new entries with your Padlock Cloud account (you can turn this
behavior off by disabling **Auto Sync** in the Padlock Cloud settings).

## 4. Setup And Pair Your Other Devices

Now that all you data is securely stored in you Padlock Cloud account you
can easily access from your other devices! To do this, simply follow
steps 1 and 2 from above on each of your devices. **Make sure to use the
same email and master password every time!**

## 5. Keep Your Data Synchronized

By default, Padlock will automatically synchronize you data with your Padlock
Cloud account every time you unlock the app, add a new record or make a change
to an existing one. You can also synchronize manually by clicking
**Synchronize** in the Padlock Cloud screen.

# Troubleshooting

## I'm not receiving an email when trying to pair my device.

If no email shows up in your inbox, go to the Padlock Cloud screen and make
sure you've provided the correct address without any typos. If the email
address shown there is incorrect, click **Cancel**, enter your correct email
address and click **Pair Device**. It's also possible that the email ended up
in your spam folder so make sure to check there as well!

## Some changes I've made on one device don't show up on my other device.

Try to manually synchronize both devices. The order is important here - first
synchronize the device you made the changes on, then the other device. Also
make sure both devices are paired with the same Padlock Cloud account!

## When tyring to synchronize, the app prompts me for a password but entering my master password doesn't work.

This happens if you've previously synchronized the app with your Padlock Cloud
account while using a different master password. If you remember which password
you were using previously, try that one. If you can't remember, you'll have
to reset your data stored on your Padlock Cloud account. You can do this from
the [Padlock Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard/). Once you've
done this, you should be able to synchronize normally.

## I'm getting an error message.

This may be due to a temporary server outage, a problem with your network connection
other other things. Simply try again a while later. If the problem persists, please
contact us at [support@padlock.io](mailto:support@padlock.io).
