This privacy policy documents how and when Padloc stores, handles and
processes user data, specifically your sensitive, private and 'personal
identifiable' information as well as your rights regarding this data. Since
this document is meant to inform you, the user, it is written in plain, easily
understandable language. We will try to communicate to you all the most
important facts without going into too much technical detail or overwhelming
you with too much information. Please read this document carefully. If you have
any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us at
[support@padloc.app](support@padloc.app)!

As a user of Padloc, you entrust us with some of your most sensitive and
private data and we recognise the immense responsibility that comes with this.
Padloc is built from the ground up with a focus on security, privacy
and transparency and we employ these principles every step along the way
when handling your data. As a security-sensitive service, cryptography and
information security is at the very heart of our product and while these
topics can be very hard to grasp for non-technical users, we do our best
to describe the most important principles in simple words.

## Who We Are

Padloc is maintained and run by **MaKleSoft**, a German company located at
Meisenstr. 5, 91522 Ansbach, Bavaria. MaKleSoft and all of it's employees are
bound by EU privacy laws and regulations like the **General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

## Information We Collect And How We Use It

While we treat all your data with the same high standard of security,
there are different types of data and it is important to understand
the distinction between them.

### Secure Data

Your secure data is all the information you store within the Padloc app, like passwords, credit card details, secure
notes and other sensitive (or non-sensitive) information. By design this data is readable by you and only you. Your
secure data is encrypted locally on your devices using encryption keys that are derived from your master password that
only you know and your data is never stored or transmitted in plain text. While we do store your encrypted data on our
servers for synchronization or backup purposes we are never in the position to decrypt this data.

We never store your master password in any way and will never ask you to reveal it to us. Please note that this also
means that we won't be able to help you recover you plain text data in case you loose your password.

Your secure data is your property and you have full control over it. You may read, edit or delete your data at any point
without our permission. Accessing your secure data stored on our servers requires authentication via your email address
and master password.

### Account Meta Data

In order to authenticate you with our servers and to provide some of the essential functionality offered by Padloc, we
require some additional information from you. The first and most important piece of information is your email address.
Your email address is used to uniquely identify your account and serves as a means of authentication. In addition to
your email address, we also ask you for a display name. This information is optional and does not have to be your real
name. In addition to your email address and display name, we are some collecting some additional data when you interact with
our service:

#### Device-specific Information

Device-specific information includes:

- Device UUID<sup>1</sup>
- Operating System and OS Version
- Device Manufacturer (if available)
- Device Model (if available)
- Device Name (if available)
- App Version
- Last Access

This information is essential for preventing fraud and to provide you
fine-grained control of which devices you want to allow (and continue to allow)
access to your account. Information about your device model, operating
system and OS version also helps us notifying you in case we are made aware
of security vulnerabilities specific to your device or operating system.

<sup>1</sup> Your devices "Universal Unique Identifier" is a unique, random
string of characters used to uniquely identify a given device in our systems.
This string is generated automatically and is _not_ directly tied to your devices
serial number, mac address or other immutable identifiers unique to your device.
In other words, this is only useful for our internal use and is not considered
personal identifiable information.

### Usage Data

For our internal use, we track basic usage data like app installs, updates
and device activity. Since Padloc is a security-sensitive application that
requires constant maintenance and security updates to patch vulnerabilities and
maintain it's high standard in security, it is essential for us to know which
app versions are in circulation and on which kind of devices. For instance,
knowing which operating systems make up the majority of our user base, we are
able to prioritize OS-specific vulnerabilities should they arise. This usage
data is completely anonymised and does not contain any personal identifiable
information.

### Server Logs

Like most internet services, we keep internal logs of all requests sent to our
servers. These logs are an essential tool for identifying and blocking
malicious traffic and help us detect and prevent break-in attempts. These logs
may contain some personal identifiable information like IP addresses.
As with all the data that we collect, we treat these log files with utmost care
and restrict access to them to key personnel. Log files are only kept as long
as absolutely necessary after which they are deleted from our servers.

### Billing Information

If you choose to purchase a paid subscription, your payment data is processed
and stored securely by our payment provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com). In
addition to your credit card data, you may choose to provide us with additional
billing information like your full name, address and, in case of business
customers, your business name and VAT number.

### Cookies and Tracking

We set and use cookies (small text files placed on your device) on our own
domains and subdomains to store settings that assist with identifying your
account for sign-in. We also use third party analytics packages for our public
pages that may set cookies on your computer. These are limited to our domains,
and do not involve cross-service tracking. You may disable cookies in your
browser and continue to use our services without impact.

## Where Your Data Is Kept

Your data is held by third party data processors, who provide us with hosting
and other infrastructure services. All of these providers are GDPR-compliant
and conform to the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield Framework.

## Who Has Access To Your Data

Your personal information is stored behind secured networks and is only
accessible by a very limited number of persons who have special access rights
to such systems and are required to keep the information confidential.

## Third Party Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally
identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does
not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in
operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as
those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

## Deleting Your Data

We are merely custodians of your data and we have no interested in keeping your personal information any longer than you
want us to or is required by law. You can delete your Padloc online account at any time through the settings section
within the app or, in case of legacy Padlock 2 accounts, via [Padlock Cloud Legacy Online
Dashboard](https://cloud.padlock.io/dashboard/).

German tax law requires us to keep payment transaction records and, in case of business customers, company and VAT
information for up to 10 years. This data does not include your credit or debit card information which is deleted
instantly after deleting your Padloc online account.

Disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that we have a legitimate interest in maintaining secure and
immutable backups. Erasure requests will leave those backups untouched, and we will only remove data from backups if
legally compelled to. Backups are permanently deleted after 3 months.

## Contacting You

We may use your contact information to communicate with you about service activity, provide support, and send you other
information such as product updates and announcements. You may choose to stop receiving communications from us, except
certain important notifications such as billing and account security alerts.
