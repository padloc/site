We've made you wait for way too long, but now it is finally here! The [Padloc
browser extension](/downloads/#browser-extensions) gives you fast and
convenient access to you Padloc account directly from your browser!

In addition to being a full-featured Padloc client (you can do almost
everything you can do with the native apps), the extensions nicely integrates
with the browser it lives in, giving you a few extra features. Here are just
some of the things the Padloc Extension can do:

-   Access and manage your vaults and organizations directly from the browser.
-   Automatically finds relevant entries for you based on the site your visiting.
-   Fill out form elements with an intuitive drag & drop interaction.
-   Conveniently fill forms directly from the context menu (right click on any
    form element).
-   All the other features you know from our other apps, like a powerful password
    generator, file previews and more!

The Padloc Browser extension is available now for Firefox and Chrome via the
respective extension stores. Check out our [download
section](/downloads/#browser-extensions) for the links!

Oh and one more thing: The drag & drop feature is also available in the latest
version of our desktop apps and the web client and it doesn't just
work with web pages! Go ahead, try it! ðŸ˜‰
