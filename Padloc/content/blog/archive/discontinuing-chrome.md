In August 2016, [Google
announced](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/from-chrome-apps-to-web.html) that
they would be **discontinuing support for Chrome Web Apps for all Platforms
except ChromeOS by early 2018**. [Padlock for
Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/padlock/npkoefjfcjbknoeadfkbcdpbapaamcif)
was the first version of Padlock available on the Desktop, but even before
Googles announcement it was getting clear that it was time to find a
better way to distribute Padlock for Desktop environments. Last year we
released the first beta versions of our native apps for [MacOS]({{< relref
"mac-beta.md" >}}) and [Windows]({{< relref "win-beta.md" >}}). With the
[release of Padlock 2.0]({{< relref "v2.0-released.md" >}}), these are now
officially out of beta! Our native apps feature the same user experience,
higher security and a better performance than Padlock for Chrome so there is no
reason not to switch right now!

**Note:** This announcement is only for Padlock for Chrome on Windows, MacOS
and Linux. Padlock will continue to be available for ChromeOS via the Chrome
Web Store for the foreseeable future.
