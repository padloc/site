Due to a bug in version 2.3, Padlock for Desktop will not automatically discover
any new updates unless the **Automatically Download And Install Updates** option is
enabled. You can find this option under **Settings > Updates**. To install the update,
simply enable this option and restart the app.

Alternatively, you can download the new version manually from our [downloads
page](/downloads/).

## Design And User Experience Refinements

One thing that sets Padlock apart from other password managers is our focus on
user experience and design. We don't just want Padlock to be secure and
efficient, but also visually pleasing and fun to use.

We think you'll love the visual refinements that we made for Padlock 2.4!
Especially the desktop app now looks better than ever. We made some changes to
make the app look more consistent across different operating systems while
still retaining the native look and feel on each platform. Padlock now also
takes full advantage of the beautiful screen on the iPhone X!

## Improved Setup Process

The biggest functional changes in v2.4 is a new and improved setup screen.
Padlock will now guide new users through the setup process step-by-step,
offering useful information and tips along the way. We think that the setup
process is one of the most critical parts of the user experience and the one
that probably causes the most confusion for new users. We will continue to
improve this process by introducing more guidance and tools for things like
choosing a master password, setting up regular backups and more!

## We Love Your Feedback!
