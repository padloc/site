**We're excited to announce the official release of Padlock Cloud v1.0!** For
those who are not yet familiar with it, Padlock Cloud is an online storage
service for the Padlock app that provides a secure and convenient way to back
up your data in the cloud and seamlessly synchronize changes between devices.
Just like the Padlock app itself, Padlock Cloud is completely open source and
with this [first official stable
release](https://github.com/MaKleSoft/padlock-cloud/releases/tag/v1.0.0) of the
source code, it is now easier than ever to deploy a custom instance of the
service to your own server! For details on how to do this, check out the
[Padlock Cloud repository on
Github](https://github.com/maklesoft/padlock-cloud)

The most significant addition feature-wise is the new online dashboard for
managing Padlock Cloud accounts. It is important to note that the dashboard
is not meant to offer users an additional way of accessing their plain-text
data but instead will give them access to advanced features like reseting their
data or revoking access for previously paired devices.

For those of you who don't trust us with storing your sensitive (albeit
encrypted) data or simply don't want to pay for the official Padlock Cloud
service, we want to make it as easy as possible to set up your own Padlock
Cloud servers so stay tuned for future articles on how to deploy Padlock Cloud
to various platforms and providers! If you have any questions or want to
request a how-to article for a specific platform/provider, don't hesitate to
