**Padlock 2.6 is out, and it's one of the biggest updates yet!** The main goal
of this release was to refine the user experience in some key parts of the
app, and after a lot of hard work, we couldn't be more happy with the result!
Here are some of the changes you'll find in the new version:

## New Main Menu

In previous versions of Padlock we could get away without using a full menu but
as we are starting to include more features, we found that we needed to find a
better way of accessing advanced functionality and move between different parts
of the user interface. The new main menu does not only look cool, but also
provides a clearer, more transparent way of navigating the app. We're far from
done though! Stay tuned for more improvements like better accessibility and
productivity-boosting keyboard shortcuts!

## Improved Cloud Integration

Being able to easily share your data between all your devices is one of the
key features of Padlock, but also one of the most technically challenging.
We want to give you the most seamless, user friendly experience possible
which is why we are continuously working on improving the way you access
your online data from within the app. Padlock 2.6 introduces a number of
significant improvements in this area, like an improved pairing process,
the ability to manage your account directly from with the app and more!

## Auto Updates For Linux

The Windows and Mac versions of Padlock for desktop have been able to receive
auto updates for a while, but until now, Linux users had to download and
install updates manually. This changes with Padlock 2.6, as auto updates
are now officially supported for Linux as well!
