**We're excited to announce the release of Padlock 2.3!** Continuing the theme
of listening to our users feedback, we are introducing two new, often requested
features in this release:

## New "Recently Used" Section

We believe that quickly and efficiently finding the data you need is one of the
most important features of any password manager. The filter function already
offers a very fast and convenient way to find a specific record. Padlock v2.3
introduces another feature that will save a lot of time for our users. Recently
used records will now appear at the top of the list where you can view or copy
your data with a single click!

## Deleting And Exporting Multiple Records

In previous versions, cleaning up old records could be cumbersome because one
had to delete each item individually. The new multi-select feature now allows
to you select and delete multiple items directly from the list view! In
addition to that, it's now also possible to export and share a number of specific
records instead of all records at once. To enter multi-select mode, simply
click on the check mark icon next to the record name of any item in the list.

The opinion of our users is immensely important to us. If you have any feedback
or suggestions on how to improve Padlock, please don't hesitate to [shoot us an
email](mailto:support@padlock.io)! Or maybe you think Padlock is perfect the
way it is and want to help spread the word? We'd really appreciate it if
you could take a moment to rate the app in the app store on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id871710139),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maklesoft.padlock),
