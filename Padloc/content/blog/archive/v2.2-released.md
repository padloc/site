We're happy to announce the release of another incremental update! Padlock
version 2.2.0 addresses an issue that was brought up by many of our users. In
previous versions field values in the record view would always be displayed
openly without a way to hide sensitive values short of closing the record
completely. This can be a problem when using Padlock in a public place where
others might use the opportunity to catch a glimpse of your data.

Starting with this release, field values will be masked by default until
explicitly revealed by the user. Values can still be copied to the clipboard with
a single click without the risk of exposing the information to others.
Additionally, the 'peek' feature in the list view, which allows uses to take a
peek at a field value by moving the mouse over the corresponding field, has
been disabled by default since some users have expressed similar concerns about
accidentally exposing their data through this feature. If you would like to
re-enable this feature, you can do so from the settings screen.

We'd like to thank everyone who is helping to make Padlock better by providing
feedback or offering direct contributions! A special shout-out to Github
user [pwasiewicz](https://github.com/pwasiewicz) who helped fix various issues
by contributing directly to our open source code base!

The opinion of our users is immensely important to us. If you have any feedback
or suggestions on how to improve Padlock, please don't hesitate to [shoot us an
email](mailto:support@padlock.io)! Or maybe you think Padlock is perfect the
way it is and want to help spread the word? We'd really appreciate it if
you could take a moment to rate the app in the app store on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id871710139),
