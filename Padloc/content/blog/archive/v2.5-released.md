We're happy to announce another incremental update! Apart from the usual bug
fixes and minor tweaks, **Padlock 2.5** introduces two major changes:

## Visual Clipboard

Using the clipboard is a convenient and fast way to transfer data between
Padlock and other applications. However, letting sensitive data sit in your
clipboard for an extended amount of time can be dangerous, as other
applications may access this data without you noticing. To mitigate this, and
to make using the clipboard even more convenient and secure, **we're introducing
the new visual clipboard**! Whenever you copy something to the clipboard, Padlock
will display which field was copied, along with the option to clear the
clipboard immediately. As an additional security measure, Padlock will clear
the clipboard automatically after 60 seconds.

## Customize Database Location

Starting with version 2.5 Padlock now allows you to choose where your database
file is stored! The **Database** section in the settings screen offers you the
option to either store your existing database in a different location or to
load a different database file. Simply click one of the two options, select the
desired path and confirm!
