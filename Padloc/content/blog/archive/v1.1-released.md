Today we're releasing v1.1 of the Padlock app for Android, iOS and Google
Chrome / Chrome OS. Apart from the usual bug fixes and tweaks, this version
introduces a couple of minor changes to take full advantage of the latest
features added to Padlock Cloud. Most notably, users can now manage their
account and connected devices through the new online dashboard!

We'd also like to take this opportunity to announce our plans to release
standalone desktop versions for Windows, MacOS and Linux in the very near
future! Right now, Padlock on Desktop is only available via the Chrome
Web Store, requiring users to download Google Chrome in order to install
the app. The new desktop versions will allow you to download and install
the app right from this website without any additional software requirements!
Stay tuned!
