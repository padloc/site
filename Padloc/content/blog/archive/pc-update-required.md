title: 'Update to v1.0 to Keep Using Padlock Cloud!'
archived: true
---

Along with the [release of Padlock v1.0]({{< relref "v1.0-released.md" >}}) we
are also rolling out a major update to the Padlock Cloud service.
Unfortunately, this means that **Padlock Cloud clients of version 0.12 or
earlier will not be able to access Padlock Cloud anymore**. When trying to
synchronize data or pair new devices, the app will show a generic error
message.

In addition, users will receive an email reminding them to update to the latest
version of Padlock. Don't worry, your data is still there! In order to keep
using Padlock Cloud, simply **update the app to v1.0 or greater**. Note that
after updating the app, you will also have to pair your device again. To do
this, simply go to **Settings > Padlock Cloud** and select **Connect**.

We apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. If you have any questions
or concerns, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:support@padlock.io)!

**Note:** The Google Chrome version will update itself automatically but you
might have to restart Chrome for the update to take effect!
