**It's time for another update!** Apart from the usual bug fixes and tweaks,
Padlock 2.7 brings some new features and user experience improvements.
Without further ado, here are some of the changes you'll find in this release:

## Introducing Tags

Probably the most significant in this release is the introduction of **tags**.
Tags are replacing what was previously called 'categories' and they work in
much the same way while being more flexible and generally more powerful.

Where you could only add a single category to each record, you can now add as
many tags as you'd like! Tags, just like the old categories, are incredibly
useful to group certain related records together, making discovering and
managing your data even easier! For example, you might want to distinguish your
personal secrets from work-related data or your financial information for your
social media accounts.

Want to list all records related to a certain tag? Simply type the tag name in
the search bar or select it from the new **Tags** section in the main menu!
Tags are designed to be easy and intuitive to use while giving you a
maximum amount of flexibility. You decide how (and if!) you want to use them.

Don't worry, you won't use your existing categories as they'll simply be
converted to tags!

## Improved UX For Viewing And Editing Fields

Providing an intuitive yet flexible way of interacting fields (the actual data
stored within your records) has always been one of our main challenges when it
comes to usability. Our goal is to provide a consistent user experience on all
platforms - both mobile and desktop - while still utilizing the strengths of
each environment.

For example, if you've used the iOS or Android app, we want your to feel
right at home when you switch over to your Mac, Windows or even Linux machine.
To that end, we are continuously refining and tweaking our user interface to
get closer to that seamless, intuitive user experience that our users are
looking for. We hope you'll like the changes we've made in this version!

## Removed "Hover-To-Reveal" Feature

Adding features is always nice, but sometimes, in an effort to stay true to our
philosophy of minimalist design and 'security through simplicity', we find it
necessary to reevaluate and if necessary remove existing features.

Previous versions of the desktop version allowed to quickly reveal a fields
value within the list view by moving the mouse over it. While this was a nice
little gimmick, it turned out that in practice it was not actually that useful.
In fact, many users felt that the feature was sacrificing security by causing
them to inadvertently reveal possibly sensitive information while they were
using the app in public settings. For the above reasons, we decided to remove
the feature.

Note that this change does not affect the click-to-copy functionality within
the list view, which remains one of our favorite convenience features!
