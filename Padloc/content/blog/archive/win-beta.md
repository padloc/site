title: Announcing Padlock for Windows (Beta)
archived: true
---

Two weeks ago we [announced]({{< relref "mac-beta.md" >}}) the first beta
release of our standalone desktop app for Mac. Today, with the second beta
release, we're adding support for Windows as well! To use it, simply download
and run the installer from the [downloads page](/downloads/).

For those who are already using Padlock for Mac, the new release will be
downloaded and installed automatically. For an overview over what has changed,
see the [release
notes](https://github.com/MaKleSoft/padlock/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.2).

Note that this is still a beta version, so some instability is to be expected.
If you have any questions or problems with the new version, feel free to
[contact us](mailto:support@padlock.io)!
