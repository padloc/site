On May 25 2018, the new **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** comes
into effect. The GDPR is a new, EU-wide privacy and data protection law that
marks the most important change in data privacy regulation in decades. It calls
for more granular privacy guardrails in an organization’s systems, more nuanced
data protection agreements, and more consumer-friendly and detailed disclosures
about an organization’s privacy and data protection practices.

Naturally, as custodians of your most sensitive and private data we value
privacy, security and transparency above anything else and we support and
welcome the GDPR and the new protections and rights it ensures for our users.

For you as a Padlock user, not much will change on May 25. We have always been
committed to treating your data with the utmost care and respect and will
continue to do so whether the law compels us or not. While we are introducing
some changes to our software and infrastructure to fully comply with the new
regulations, Padlock will continue to work the same way without any actions
required on your side.

We have updated our [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) to better document how we
collect, process and protect your personal information. It is written in plain,
easily understandable language and we encourage you to review it and approach
us with any questions you may have.
